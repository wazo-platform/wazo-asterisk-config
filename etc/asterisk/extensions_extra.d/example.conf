; Preprocess subroutine to call a user's mobile phone at the same time as its
; regular phone when that user is called.
;
; To use it, edit a user and:
; * set its "mobile phone number"
; * set its "preprocess subroutine" to "pre-mobility"
;
; If your internal context is not named "default", edit the subroutine below
; and substitute "default" for the name of your internal context.
;
; More information on preprocess subroutine is available in the official XiVO
; documentation.
